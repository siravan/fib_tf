abstract = {BACKGROUND Pulmonary vein (PV) ablation plays an important role in atrial fibrillation (AF) therapy but suffers from a limited mechanistic understanding of PV arrhythmogenicity. Rapid focal activation has been suggested, but some evidence points to underlying reentry. OBJECTIVE This study was performed to evaluate how the electrophysiological properties of PVs may make them a site for reentry and to analyze specifically the roles of PV dimensions and coupling properties. METHODS A computer model designed to efficiently reproduce electrophysiological behaviors was fit to action potentials from canine left atria (LA) and PVs. To assess structural and functional arrhythmogenic determinants, an idealized PV of varying length and circumference was attached to LA tissue, and 5 seconds of activity after extrastimulation were simulated. RESULTS PV reentrant activity depended critically on vein size and coupling properties. With cumulative removal of transverse and longitudinal connections, sustained (n=23) or nonsustained (n=93) reentries could be observed (687 simulations) for veins 1-3 cm long and 1-2 cm in circumference. The prevalence of sustained reentry increased with PV length (8{\%} for 1 cm vs. 22{\%} and 31{\%} for 2 and 3 cm, respectively; P{\textless}.05 for each). The PV circumference did not affect the incidence of sustained reentry (25{\%}, 17{\%}, and 21{\%} for 1-, 1.5-, and 2-cm circumferences; P=NS), but the number of reentrant events increased from 12/201 simulations for PVs with a 1-cm circumference to 48/232 and 56/254 events for PVs with 1.5- and 2-cm circumferences, respectively (P{\textless}.05). Sustained reentry cycle lengths were approximately 200-250 ms (16/23), except for the longest PVs. CONCLUSION Reentry occurs readily in PVs with realistic properties in the context of specific connection heterogeneities. Reentry properties and incidence depend on PV anisotropy and dimensions but could certainly contribute significantly to PV arrhythmogenesis.},

@article{Beeler1977,
abstract = {1. A mathematical model of membrane action potentials of mammalian ventricular myocardial fibres is described. The reconstruction model is based as closely as possible on ionic currents which have been measured by the voltage-clamp method.2. Four individual components of ionic current were formulated mathematically in terms of Hodgkin-Huxley type equations. The model incorporates two voltage- and time-dependent inward currents, the excitatory inward sodium current, i(Na), and a secondary or slow inward current, i(s), primarily carried by calcium ions. A time-independent outward potassium current, i(K1), exhibiting inward-going rectification, and a voltage- and time-dependent outward current, i(x1), primarily carried by potassium ions, are further elements of the model.3. The i(Na) is primarily responsible for the rapid upstroke of the action potential, while the other current components determine the configuration of the plateau of the action potential and the re-polarization phase. The relative importance of inactivation of i(s) and of activation of i(x1) for termination of the plateau is evaluated by the model.4. Experimental phenomena like slow recovery of the sodium system from inactivation, frequency dependence of the action potential duration, all-or-nothing re-polarization, membrane oscillations are adequately described by the model.5. Possible inadequacies and shortcomings of the model are discussed.},
